A tug of war is to be arranged at the local office picnic. For the tug of war, the picnickers must be
divided into two teams. Each person must be on one team or the other; the number of people on the
two teams must not differ by more than 1; the total weight of the people on each team should be as
nearly equal as possible.


## Input

**The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.**
The first line of input contains *n* the number of people at the picnic. *n* lines follow. The first line
gives the weight of person 1; the second the weight of person 2; and so on. Each weight is an integer
between 1 and 450. There are at most 100 people at the picnic.


## Output
